# Database-Design
In this project, I served as a Business Intelligence Analyst tasked with designing and populating a relational database for a new streaming service, Ireflix. The project involved creating a comprehensive database structure, populating it with relevant data, establishing relationships between tables, and executing complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.

Key Responsibilities:
1.	Database Design and Creation:
  - Designed and created the database schema for Ireflix, including tables for Users, Movies, Series, Actors, and Directors.
  - Defined appropriate data types, constraints, and relationships between tables, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying.
  - Implemented necessary constraints for each field, such as primary and foreign keys and length restrictions.

2.	Data Population:
  - Populated the database with a minimum of 1,000 entries, including data on the most popular movies and series from the last 10 years and classic films.
  - Ensured a diverse and comprehensive dataset by including various genres, actors, and directors from different nationalities.

3.	Table Relationships:
  - Established two key relationships within the database to facilitate complex queries and data analysis.
  - Linked tables such as Movies and Actors and Series and Directors enable efficient querying across related entities.

4.	Database Modification:
  - Executed schema modifications to add the release year to the Movies and Series tables, accommodating the app creators' request for this additional information.

5.	SQL Query Implementation:
  - Performed a query to identify the number of movies in which a selected famous actor has starred, demonstrating the actor's participation across the database.
  - Executed a complex query to list actors who have been protagonists in movies but not in series, providing insights into their acting portfolios.
